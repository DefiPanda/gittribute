gittribute
=====
Gittribute saves your time on getting help on your open-source project. Need help on your project? All you need is to add one line on your Github project's README.md & click your link there, and then everyone in the world will see you need help and they will find you.  

Usage  
---  
Add one extra line on your README.md:  
http://gittribute.herokuapp.com/user/[your_user_name_here]/repo/[your_repository_name_here]  
  
For example, if I (jw2013) want to add my repo (triangletech) to gittribute, I will type: 
```
http://gittribute.herokuapp.com/user/jw2013/repo/triangletech  
```  

Or if I want to add my repo (gittribute), I will type
```
http://gittribute.herokuapp.com/user/jw2013/repo/gittribute
```
   
You can include that url anywhere inside your README.md, however you want (e.g. typical .md link formatting is fine [description](http://gittribute.herokuapp.com/user/jw2013/repo/triangletech)). Then just either click this url, or manually type this url. Your repo will then be our site!
