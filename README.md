gittribute
=====
Gittribute saves your time on getting help on your open-source project. Need help on your project? All you need is to add one line on your Github project's README.md & click your link there, and then everyone in the world will see you need help and they will find you.  

Usage  
---  
Add one extra line on your README.md:  
http://gittribute.herokuapp.com/user/[your_user_name_here]/repo/[your_repository_name_here]  
  
For example, if I (jw2013) want to add my repo (triangletech) to gittribute, I will type: 
```
http://gittribute.herokuapp.com/user/jw2013/repo/triangletech  
```  

Or if I want to add my repo (gittribute), I will type
```
http://gittribute.herokuapp.com/user/jw2013/repo/gittribute
```
   
You can include that url anywhere inside your README.md, however you want (e.g. typical .md link formatting is fine [description](http://gittribute.herokuapp.com/user/jw2013/repo/triangletech)). Then just either click this url, or manually type this url. Your repo will then be our site!  JUST DON'T FORGET TO CLICK THE URL ONCE YOU ADD THE URL TO README.md.
